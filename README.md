## Description

A product page


| TERM  | DESCRIPTION  | IMPLEMENTATION |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| border-box      | Determines when parts should be included the div area. | I used it to keep width/height in check for areas including the product purchase section. |
| centered content      | Moves elements to the center.        |   I used margin-left and margin-right auto to move the header to center it horizontally. |
| clear-fix      | Clears an element so it is not floating with another element.        |   I used it to move the product information part away from the small floating images. |
| display: box      | Sets a div as a block instead of as a line of text.       |   I used it to move .product-info as a chunk. |
| display: inline      | Makes something resemble a line of text rather than a block.        |   I used it to make the lists look like links as a navigational bar. |
| float      | Moves an element outside of the standard structure without removing it from the structure.        |   I used it to move parts like the purchase area to be by the product image instead of below it. |
| positional selector      | Determines how an element is positioned based on its divs (and parent/child relations).        |   I selected positions absolute and relative to ensure that certain parts of my page were responsive. |
| pseudo-class      | Defines a stage of an element, such as when a link is being hovered over.        |   I used :hover, for example, to make my links red when hovered over. |
| pseudo-element     | Styles specific parts of an element.        |   I had my main product image state that there is a limited stock of the item. |
| selector-combination      | Allows targeting specific parts/elements of a div.       |   I targeted the product image separately from the gallery images so that it would be of a different size. |
